The Witches Society is an online submission blog page where users can submit their own spells to a collaborative Grimoire. The site provides a fun community space where like minded individuals can come together and share their spell knowledge. All users are free to browse the blog. Users may create a user profile account if they wish to contribute their own spells to the blog.

## User Experience (UX)

After researching into similar existing witch themed sites I decided to opt for a simple, feminine, monochomatic colour palette as I found most sites to be overwhelmingly dark in theme.

## Fonts

- [Irish Grover](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Irish+Grover/tester?categoryFilters=Appearance:%2FTheme%2FWacky) was used for the site Logo.
- [Rubik](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Rubik) was used for the site's main content.
