# The Witches Society

The Witches Society is an online submission blog page where users can submit their own spells to a collaborative Grimoire. The site provides a fun community space where like minded individuals can come together and share their spell knowledge. All users are free to browse the blog. Users may create a user profile account if they wish to contribute their own spells to the blog.

## User Experience (UX)

After researching into similar existing witch themed sites I decided to opt for a simple, feminine, monochomatic colour palette as I found most sites to be overwhelmingly dark in theme.
